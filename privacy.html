			<h2>Privacy Notice</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="container mt-3">
			<p>This privacy statement has been made by Smile Kiddie Shop and concerns only customers of Smile Kiddie Shop and users of our website: http://www.smileuniforms.com</p>


			<p>Smile Kiddie Shop ensures that your privacy is protected when using our services. This Privacy Policy (“policy”) applies to information that is collected by Smile Kiddie Shop. This policy applies only to information collected at smileuniforms.com, through any smileuniforms.com related mobile application, through a computerized device in U.S. stores, or any location where the policy is posted (collectively, the “Sites”). Any changes we have made to this Privacy policy can be found by visiting us online. When we do make changes, we will update the “Last Updated” date below. Where changes are viewed as more material, we may attempt to contact you or we will post a notice on this website that we have made changes to this policy.</p> <br>


			<h4>How is your information used?</h4>
			<p>By providing your personal data, you give consent for us at Smile Kiddie Shop to provide in full the services that we guarantee. Those services include:</p>
			<span>- Processing your online order (your name, address, date of birth, and bank details)</span> <br>
			<span>- Ensuring that you are of legal age to shop online (your date of birth)</span> <br>
			<span>- Contacting you in the event that there is an issue with the delivery of your order (telephone number, email address)</span> <br> <br>
			<p>We will only keep your data for as long as necessary to carry out our services to you or as long as we are required by law. After this your personal data will be deleted. We cannot remove your data when there is a legal storage requirement, such as book keeping rules or when there is a legal ground to keep the data, such as an ongoing contractual relationship.</p> <br>
			<h4>What are your rights?</h4>
			<p>You have the right to request information about the personal data we hold on you. If your data is incorrect, incomplete or irrelevant you can ask to have the information corrected or removed. Annually, you also have the right to request written documentation, free of charge, on the personal information we have on you on our account files. To request this document please write in to Smile Kiddie Shop. You can contact us by telephone at (215) 843-3424 or by email at sales@smileuniforms.com.</p> <br>


			<h4>Who has access to your data?</h4>
			<p>We do not sell your information to third parties. We do, however, share data with third parties when necessary to fulfill a transaction, complete a service, for administrative purposes, or when required by law. Additionally, we will share your data if such sharing is required by law or to protect against potential or suspected fraud. Also, if Smile Kiddie Shop undergoes a merger, corporate reorganization, or all or part of our assets are sold or acquired by another party, your personal data may be shared. If you do not want us to share your personal data in these manners, please do not provide it to us.</p> <br>
			<h4>How do we protect your data?</h4>
			<p>No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you understand that any information that you transfer to us is done at your own risk. That said, once we receive your transmission, we have technical and organizational measures in place to help protect your data from loss, manipulation, unauthorised access, etc. We continually adapt our security measures in line with technological progress and developments. At Smile Kiddie Shop we protect your data using encryption using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). SSL is a function that encrypts all information sent between you and Smile Kiddie Shop, including card information, so that card details cannot be read by external parties.</p>
			<p>For card purchases we work with an authorised payment agent that helps us to check directly with your bank that the card is valid for purchases. Our payment agent processes your card details in line with the PCI DSS requirements.</p> <br>
			<h4>Minors</h4>
			<p>We do not collect any personal data directly from individuals under the age of 13. If we discover that any such information is in our possession, we will delete it.</p> <br>
			<h4>What data do we collect?</h4>
			<p>This policy applies only to information collected on the Sites. We collect two types of information from visitors to the Sites: (1) Personal data and (2) Non-personal data.</p>
			<p>“Personal data” is information that identifies you personally, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, and sometimes your Internet Protocol (IP) address. We may collect this information when you create a profile on our Sites, visit our Sites, or complete a purchase.</p>
			<p>“Non-personal data” can be technical in nature. It does not identify you personally. Our site uses “cookies,” which are small text files that are saved to and during subsequent visits, retrieved from, your computer or mobile device. We use cookies to store your shipping country and shopping cart. You can easily erase cookies from your computer or mobile device using your browser. For instructions on how to handle and delete cookies, please look under "Help" in your browser. You have the option of setting your browser to reject cookies. However, if our cookie is rejected, we will not be able to keep items in your shopping cart and you will not be able to complete your order online. For you to complete your order, you must allow Smile Kiddie Shop to use a cookie.</p> <br>
			<h4>Links</h4>
			<p>The Sites <span class="font-weight-bold">may</span> include links to other websites which don't fall under our supervision. We cannot accept any responsibility for the protection of the privacy or the content of these websites, but we offer these links to make it easier for our visitors to find more information about specific subjects.</p> <br>
			<h4>Legal Disclaimer</h4>
			<p>We may disclose personal information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process served on our Web site.</p> <br>
